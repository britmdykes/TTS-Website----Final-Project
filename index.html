			<p> Hi, I'm Brittany! I was born and raised in Baton Rouge, Louisiana and now reside in New Orleans, Louisiana. I studied Cellular and Molecular Biology at Tulane Univserity. After graduting, I decided to go a completely different route in life and am not currently working for a tech start-up. I handle customer retention/customer success. I am in the process of learning different coding languages. I can wear many different hats and I'm never afraid to try something new. </p> <br> <br>
			<p> I am an active member in the rugby community in New Orleans. I was part of the beginning of the rebirth of <span style="color:green;">Tulane Women's Rugby Football Club</span>. In my second year on the team, I was Vice President and assisted in bringing the recruitment rate up by 200%. Through fundraising and sponsorships, we were able to secure jerseys for the team. In TWRFC 3rd year, we were finally eligible to play competitvely. That year we won the DII Spring National Championship. Since then the team has gone to the DII Spring National Championship 3 times and has won 2/3. I currently play for the Louisiana women's club team, Lagniappe, and plan on continuing for years to come! </p> <br>
